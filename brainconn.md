### About the project
During my postdoc in the [Vascular Imaging Lab](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/labs/vascular-imaging/vascular-imaging) at the University of Calgary, I spearheaded a project to explore the relationship of structural and functional connectivity across the normal adult lifespan in 7 resting-state networks using DTI and rs-fMRI data acquired from about 200 adults in an on-going normative study in Calgary. I developed image processing pipeline to analyze MRIs of T1, DTI, rs-fMRI in Matlab and bash scripts using FreeSurfer, FSL, Diffusion Toolkit / TrackVis to derive brain connectivity metrics. Processing of the images was done using the high performance computing cluster infrastructure managed by the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en) (formerly known as WestGrid).

I received trainee exchange funding to spend one month at the [Melbourne Neuroscience Institute](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/strengths/initiatives/interdisciplinary/institutes/former-melbourne-interdisciplinary-research-institutes/melbourne-neuroscience-institute) and collaborated with a mulidisciplinary team to investigate multi-modal biomarkers for brain concussion in amateur Australian football players where I applied my in-house developed image processing pipeline of MRI data to compare difference between the football players and an age-matched healthy control group.

I also collaborated with investigators and trainees in the [Calgary Stroke Program](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/departments/dcns/programs/the-calgary-stroke-program) to explore utility of applying relevant parts of my image processing pipeline to their research projects. I helped co-lead seminar with other postdoc fellows to share statistical analyses in MRI research studies and also supervised undergraduate students in their summer research projects.
