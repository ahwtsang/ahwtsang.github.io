## **My professional journey**
My interest in engineering goes back to my childhood where I enjoyed building things to solve a problem. I started my career writing software for network switches and train signaling systems after I received my undergraduate degree in computer engineering from the University of Ottawa.

It has long been my aspiration to develop my career in the intersection of engineering and medical science. One area that sparked my interest is in medical imaging where advances in the imaging technology and analysis methods had contributed significantly to help us understand the biological processes of many diseases leading to breakthrough discovery of novel treatments.

I moved to Edmonton to pursue my Ph.D in biomedical engineering at the University of Alberta in 2007 and spent 6 incredible years learning about MRI from brilliant scientists and colleagues. I had hands-on experience in designing and running experiments, scanning phantoms, volunteers, and patients, preparing conference abstracts and journal manuscripts, presenting at symposiums and scientific meetings. I began attending [ISMRM](https://www.ismrm.org/) as a trainee where it broadened my horizon on the applications of MRI in medicine. After graduation, I did my postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Hong Kong and Calgary to further my training in image analysis and processing. I obtained my professional engineering (P.Eng) license with [APEGA](https://www.apega.ca/) in 2015 through all the trainings and my prior experience.

I was fortunate and grateful for the opportunity to work for Biogen after my postdoc as imaging scientist to contribute in the launch and operation of a real-world evidence generation program to advance personalized medicine in multiple sclerosis clinical practice. 

Currently I am a principal engineer at Elucid, a medical device startup, developing image analysis software for clinical decision support in cardiovascular disease supporting regulatory clearance and commercialization strategy.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience in collaborative research, build and maintain relationships with key opinion leaders, devise and implement imaging biomarkers in clinical studies, data analysis, software engineering in a regulated environment to deliver a commercial product all of which leads to improving treatment options for patients with various detrimental diseases.

## **A little bit more about me ...**
I enjoy running, cycling, hiking, skiing, and traveling. I love being outdoor, itâ€™s a way for me to unwind and relax. I began running regularly during grad school and have been running weekly since then. I completed my first half marathon in 2020 and currently training for a full marathon hopefully in the near future. Some of my favorite hiking trails are located in Canmore, Banff, Jasper, Waterton, and New Hampshire. I skied at Mont Tremblant, Whistler, Lake Louise, Sunshine Village, Marmot Basin, Snowbird, Killington, and Stowe. I look forward to growing this list and hope to ski in the Swiss Alps one day. I have travelled to Japan, Taiwan, Australia, Singapore, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Bermuda, and Mexico. My bucket list includes South Korea, New Zealand, Peru, Brazil, Portugal, Spain.
