I am biomedical engineer currently working at <a href="https://elucid.com/">Elucid</a>, a medical device startup that delivers CTA-based arterial analysis software for personalized patient care.
I hope you will get to know who I am from reading my profile and past projects. My passion is to advance medical imaging science to improve clinical diagnosis and develop new treatment options for patients. 
If you are in similar field or have potential opportunities that we can collaborate, I would like to connect and hear from you.
