I am a biomedical engineer passionate about advancing healthcare through medical imaging. I am deeply curious about emerging technologies that can improve disease diagnosis and treatment, and my work is driven by a desire to merge innovation with practical solutions in healthcare. I invite you to explore my journey and projects, and Iâ€™d be grateful to connect and discuss shared interests. If our fields align, I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and create impactful advancements together.
